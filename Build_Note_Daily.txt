This is a daily build of tightdb core and tightdb C# bindings for Windows and .net

This daily build is not guarenteed to work, and is not tested thoroughly.

This is work in progress.

This is useful for evaluation, for integration tests, for checking if bugs have been fixed, 
useful to get an early-view of new stuff coming in later releases - if the new stuff gets released at
all.

This is highly experimental and can contain new features that will never get released.

It is not meant to be used in production - use only releases in production. This is a daily build. Not tested!

Some days, the daily build will not run at all. Other days it will certanly not work as expected.
