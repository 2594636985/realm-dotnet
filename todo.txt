Create virtual 64 bit windows to be used for testing
(1 day)

(most of the time spent in the above 3 tasks is installing windows, .net and visual studio and perhaps nunit - we can save quite some time if we decide just to try it out on existing windows installations we have access to -and wait with the rest to some other time)
