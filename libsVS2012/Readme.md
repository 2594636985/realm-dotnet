#Directory : LibsVS2012#

This is a marker readme do not delete it, or this directory will disappear

This directory is used when building the VS2012 windows version of the c++ part of the C# bindings  

As VS2010 will only build using VS2010 built libs, and VS2012 will only build using VS2012 build libs - this directory exists in two versions, called LIBSVS2010 and LIBSVS2012

The vs2012 windows release archive of the core build should be extracted in this directory

remember to delete old files first, remove the src directory and remove the lib files.
keep old archives in case you need them later
