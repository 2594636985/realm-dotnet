DESCR     : >
            The C# binding of TightDB is not documented. Please try the tutorial.
STATUS:
  CODE    : Experimental
  DESCR   : >
            The C# binding is currently in an experimental state, gathering feedback
            from users. Changes to the API should therefore be expected.
            It implements most functionality found in the core (C++) library,
            but lacks various methods.
            Compared to other typed language bindings (C++, Java) it currently
            only implements the "dynamic" classes.
