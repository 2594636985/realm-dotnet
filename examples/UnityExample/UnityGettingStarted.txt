How to run tutorial inside Unity, by creating a game that runs tutorial and outputs the results

0) install unity 4 (tested with 4.2.1f4)

1) create a new empty unity project named UnityTutorial. Select 2 by 3 layout in the top right corner.

2) drag TightDbCSharp.dll from 3.5\bin\release onto the project plane, assets area of unity
(currently this 3.5 has to have been built with xamarin instead of VS - this dependency is soon to be removed)

3) highlight assets in projct window.  in main menu select Assets->Create ->C# script
in the now active edit, type UnityTutorial

4) click the unitytutorial source in the inspector, and click the open button (this should launch an editor)

5) paste everything from tightdb_csharp\unitytutorialsource.cs into the UnityTutorial.cs open in the unity editor, totally 
replacing whatever is already there (open unitytutorialsource.cs in notepad, ctrl-A , ctrl-C go to the unity editor called monodevelop ctrl-A del, ctrl-V)

6) In the editor select Build->Rebuild all

7) back in unity, click the UnityTutorial.cs script in assets, and drag it to "Main Camera" in Heirarchy and drop it there
 
8) select assets->reimport

9) right clicking assets You should find a "show in explorer" menu option.
select that option.

10) in the explorer wiew of your assets directory, navigate to its parent directory (probably named UnityTutorial).

11) in this directory, copy tightdb_c_cs201232r.dll and tightdb_c_cs201264r.dll from 3.5\bin\release 

12) click the play button on top of the screen. Make sure the blue game area is at least 1000 pixels wide (the menu is at the far right)

You should now have a game preview with a tightDB Menu where You can Click C# system info, CPP System info and Run Tutorial
c# System Info will report information back from the tightdb c# binding
CPP System Info will load the c++ part of tightdb and report back from there
Run Tutorial will run the tutorial and put console output into the game.


13) select File->build settings

14) architecture - select x86

15) select build, name the game tutorial32bit - test run the exe file it should work just fine (1280x1024 min. to get the menu)

16) do 13 and 14 again, selecting x86-64,call the game tutorial64bit

17) test run the 64 bit app. note that the info screens reports that we are now running 64 bit and the 64 bit tightdb core is used

todo:(not in asana)
1) Get rid of whatever is stopping the 3.5 .net version from running 32 bit inside unity - some console.writeline calls it seems -perhaps introduce a Unity variable that can be used to toggle off code that unity cannot handle.

2) Find out how the c++ dll binaries ought to be put into the unity project so that they will become part of it, instead of somethings that we must copy to the right place manually

3) Figure how to run our unit tests inside Unity. Have tried, but the test runner did not report any tests run which is a bit strange, even tried to send it the assembly name. (see unity test project on wincoder pc)

4) See if we can go higher version wise with the dll when we are running 64 bit unity - it seems they are using a much newer version of mono when they are running and building 64 bit.
